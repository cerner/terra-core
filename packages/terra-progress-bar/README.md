# Terra Progress Bar

[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/terra-progress-bar.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/terra-progress-bar)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-ui)

The progress bar component provides users a way to display the progress of process or activity in a graphical manner. It can be modified in height and fill color. Its styling is set such that, the `ProgressBar` element will occupy full width of its parent element and will flex based on the width of the parent container.

Note: The progress bar displays fill with respect to percentage (value between 0 and 100). If `max` isn't specified in the input to the component, then `value` corresponds to a percentage value.
