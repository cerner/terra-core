# Terra Base Upgrade Guide

## Changes from 4.0 to 5.0
* To upgrade to terra-base v5, you now need to define a locale via the locale prop when using the `<Base>` component.
* Any react-intl based exports that you were importing from terra-base should now be imported directly from react-intl.

```diff
- import { injectIntl, intlShape, FormattedMessage, IntlProvider } from terra-base;
+ import { injectIntl, intlShape, FormattedMessage, IntlProvider } from react-intl;
```

Terra-base v5.x depends on terra-i18n v4.x. It is recommended to [review the terra-i18n v3 to v4 upgrade guide](https://github.com/cerner/terra-core/blob/master/packages/terra-i18n/docs/UPGRADEGUIDE.md) when updating terra-base to v5.
