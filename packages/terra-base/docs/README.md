# Terra Base

The base component sets minimal global styles for an application.
This includes CSS to help normalize box-sizing, reset margins/paddings, and define global font styles.

**Note: This component should be imported before the other terra components in your app.** This is to help ensure that these styles are defined at the beginning of the [extracted stylesheet](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) and are inherited down to the other terra components.

## Getting Started

- Install with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
  - `npm install terra-base`
  - `yarn add terra-base`

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Base from 'terra-base';

<Base>
  ...
</Base>
```
