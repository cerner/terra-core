# Terra Base

The `terra-base` component will handle locale changes, manage the locale loading state, and receive customized translation messages from an application and pass theme into the `terra-in18n` I18nProvider. It also sets minimal global styles for an application; styles include CSS to help normalize box-sizing, reset margins and paddings, and define global font styles.

**Note: This component should be imported before the other terra components in your app.** This is to help ensure that these styles are defined at the beginning of the [extracted stylesheet](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) and are inherited down to the other terra components. Additionally, when used to internationalize an application, it will wrap the applicationâ€™s root component such that the entire application is within the same configured i18n context.
