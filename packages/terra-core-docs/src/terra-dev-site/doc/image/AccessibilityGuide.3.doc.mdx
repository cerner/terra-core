# Accessibility Guide for Terra Image

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="2">

**Terra Images** are used ** to represent the information in meaningful ways OR to add visual decoration to the page**.
Based on the purpose of the image, They are classified into following types.
1. **Informative Images :** Images that graphically represent concepts and information, typically pictures, photos, and illustrations. Informative images convey a simple concept or information that can be expressed in a short phrase or sentence.
2. **Decorative Images :** Decorative images don’t add information to the content of a page. For example, the information provided by the image might already be given using adjacent text, or the image might be included to make the website more visually attractive. The only purpose of an image is to add visual decoration to the page, rather than to convey information that is important to understanding the page.

</Notice>

## Why is this important?
Images and graphics make content more pleasant and easier to understand for many people, and in particular for those with cognitive and learning disabilities. They serve as cues that are used by people with visual impairments, including people with low vision, to orient themselves in the content.

However, images are used extensively on websites and can create major barriers when they are not accessible. Accessible images are beneficial in many situations, such as:
- **People using screen readers:** The text alternative can be read aloud or rendered as Braille.
- **People using speech input software:** Users can put the focus onto a button or linked image with a single voice command.
- **People browsing speech-enabled websites:** The text alternative can be read aloud.
- **Mobile web users:** Images can be turned off, especially for data-roaming.
- **Search engine optimization:** Images become indexable by search engines.

## Accessibility Considerations:

### Code Considerations

**Informative Images** must have text alternatives ( alt attribute ) that describe the information or function represented by them. This ensures that images can be used by people with various disabilities with help of assistive technologies. The text alternative should convey the meaning or content that is displayed visually, which typically isn’t a literal description of the image. In some situations a detailed literal description may be needed, but only when the content of the image is all or part of the conveyed information.

**Decorative images** must have a null (empty) alt text (alt="") so that they can be ignored by assistive technologies, such as screen readers. Text values for these types of images would add audible clutter to screen reader output or could distract users if the topic is different from that in adjacent text. Leaving out the alt attribute is also not an option because when it is not provided, some screen readers will announce the file name of the image instead.

_Whether to treat an image as informative or decorative is a judgment that should be made by Author, based on the reason for including the image on the page._

Following section describes how to use the `alt` attribute of the `Terra-Image` component in various situations.

### 1. Use [Image](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/components/cerner-terra-core-docs/image/image)
- When the `Image` contributes meaning to the current page or context.
- When the `Image` is a simple graphic or photograph that describes the intended meaning of image.
- When the `Image` conveys an impression or emotion.

See [Informative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/) for more info.

- [H37: Using alt attributes on img elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H37).

#### Examples
<InformativeImage />

### 2. Use [DecorativeImage](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/components/cerner-terra-core-docs/image/decorative-image)
- When `Image` contains text and the text is also present as real text nearby.
- When `Image` contains text and the text is only shown for visual effects.
- When `Image` is purely decorative or not intended for the user.

See [Decorative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/) for more info.

#### Related or Additional WCAG Resources for Decorative Image.
- [H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H2).
- [H67: Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that AT should ignore](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H67).

#### Examples
<DecorativeImageBar title="Decorative Image"/>

_Note: `DecorativeImage` component sets `alt` prop to empty `""` value internally to make `terra-image` as Decorative Image._

## Usability Expectations:

### Keyboard Navigation
 
`Terra-Image` does not have any keyboard navigation expectations on its own. Any content provided to the `startContent`, `endContent`, or `children` should follow the interaction expectations of those elements.
 
| Key/Sequence | Description |
|---|---|
|*none*| has no keyboard navigation unless image is made as interactive |

## Related WCAG resources:
These tutorials provide best-practice guidance on implementing accessibility in different situations. This page combined the following WCAG success criteria and techniques from different conformance levels:

- [1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content) : All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed[…]. (Level A)
- [1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text) : If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except [for customizable and essential images] (Level AA)
- [1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text-no-exception) : Images of text are only used for pure decoration or where a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed (Level AAA)
