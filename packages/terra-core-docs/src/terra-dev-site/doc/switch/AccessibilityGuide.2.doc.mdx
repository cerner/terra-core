# Accessibility Guide for Terra Switch

## Why is the accessibility of Terra Switch important? 

The accessibility of a switch is imperative because a switch is a control users use to turn a setting on or off. If switches are not accessible, it can prevent users from understanding what state the switch is in, or worse, prevent the users from interacting with the product. By implementing switches in an accessible way, we are ensuring as many users can use the switch as possible regardless of how they may interact with it (e.g., with a mouse, touch, speech input, keyboard only, or other assistive technology).  

It is critical that a switch is coded correctly to ensure it is keyboard accessible. Additionally, switch must be programmatically understood as a switch to properly convey to users of assistive technologies what type of a component they are on and how to interact with it. Users expect a switch to turn on or off a setting and not to do something unexpected. For switch to be highly usable and easily understood, it is critical that all switches be uniquely labeled and descriptive of what action(on/off) will be taken when activated. For example:  

- **Blind screen reader users** do not necessarily interact with pages in a linear fashion and can use a switch out of context. They need to know what kind of a component they are on and how to interact with It - different components have different expectations. They need the words within the switch to be descriptive of purpose.
- **People using speech input software** require unique Switch labels to effectively activate the Switch. 
- **Keyboard only users** navigate the page using only a keyboard. They expect a switch to be keyboard accessible and able to be activated using specific keys. Additionally, a visible keyboard focus is crucial for this user to see where they are on the page.

## Accessibility Considerations

### Code Considerations

- Ensure all switches receive keyboard focus and can be interacted with only the keyboard.
  - Do NOT override keyboard focus state or use a TABINDEX greater than zero. 
  - Switch should be coded in the users logical reading order of the page to ensure a meaningful experience.  
- Do NOT override the implicit/explicit role of a switch if another role is required do NOT use the Terra switch.

| Bad Practice | Good Practice |
|---|---|
|``` <Switch role="checkbox" isChecked={value} labelText="Show Patients List in Menu" onChange={setValue} /> ```|```<Switch isChecked={value} labelText="Show Patients List in Menu" onChange={setValue} /> ```|

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="4">

- Switch must have an accessible name which is descriptive of the purpose.
  - The visual name of the label must match the programmatic name.
  <div aria-label="Example demo">
      <SwitchLabel />
  </div>

  ```jsx
  import Switch from 'terra-switch'; 

    <Switch
          isChecked={value}
          labelText="Show Patients List in Menu"
          onChange={setValue}
        />
  ```

  - The visual name of the label must match the programmatic name for the Disabled Switch.
  <div aria-label="Example demo">
      <SwitchDisabledAccess />
  </div>

  ```jsx
  import Switch from 'terra-switch';

    <Switch
          labelText="Show Patient History"
          isDisabled
        />
  ```

- Ensure switch label that is visually related to content in the page must be programmatically associated with its content. For example, “Show allergies” switch (on/off) must be appropriate associated with the word allergies.
  <div aria-label="Example demo">
      <AllergiesSwitch />
  </div>

  ```jsx
  import Switch from 'terra-switch';

     <Switch
          isChecked={value}
          labelText="Show allergies"
          onChange={setValue}
       />
  ```

</Notice>

### Content Considerations:

- Must provide engineers with a meaningful and descriptive switch label that conveys the switch's purpose. 
- When implementing switch do not override default theme colors of switch to ensure the switch be easily perceived against its background color. If changing the default colors, the text color must meet a minimum contrast ratio against the background color. See WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum and 1.4.11 Non-text Content for more information.
- Not everyone perceives color so never use color as the only way to convey meaning within the interface. Always provide both color and text or a shape together to represent the meaning.
- Ensure the engineers understand the logical reading order of the page.
- Never add unexpected behaviors to switch that could cause a change of context on focus or on activation of the switch. Ensure switch always meet the user’s expectations.
- It is best practice to always have the switch in close proximity to the switch label. If the switch label and actual switch do not appear together, the extra space in-between can create accessibility and usability problems for some users.
- After coded, ensure all interactable elements receive keyboard focus in the users reading order and display a visible keyboard focus.

## Usability Expectations:

- User expects switch to have a visual and matching programmatic label that is descriptive of its purpose.
- User expects to see or hear that the actionable element in focus is a switch.
- User expects to see or hear the current state of the Switch. For example, selected/not selected, on/off, yes/no, and so on.
- If the Switch state is changed, the user expects to be informed (audibly or visually) of the new state.
- User expects the changing of switch states to result in instantaneous feedback. They do not expect to take further action to save the setting change.

### Interaction Details

Mouse users expect the cursor to change to a hand with pointing finger when the Switch is hovered. Keyboard only users expect to see a visible keyboard focus indicator when the switch is in focus.

### Keyboard Navigation

Buttons have the following keyboard navigation expectations:

| Key/Sequence | Description |
|---|---|
|**Tab**| Moves focus on and off interactable elements. User expects elements to receive focus in the logical reading order of the page. |
|**Enter**| Executes Switch action.  |
