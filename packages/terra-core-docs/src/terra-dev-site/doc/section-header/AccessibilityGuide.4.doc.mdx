# Accessibility Guide for Terra Section Header

## Why the accessibility of Terra Section Header?

> The accessibility of Section Headers is important because headers are used on virtually every page and in every product. Section Headers convey the visual and programmatic structure and informational hierarchy of the page. The context headings provide also help users understand what to expect within the content. However, if section headers are not coded correctly or use words that accurately describe the content they represent, they can cause confusion, prevent users from understanding, and create accessibility barriers.
> 
> The code behind the headings provides context to the structure of the page and allows additional navigational methods for some assistive technology users. Improperly coded headings create accessibility barriers to these users.

## Accessibility Considerations.

### Content Considerations

- Ensure each Section Header has a meaningful label that describe the purpose of the heading.
  - Section Headers must accurately describe the content they represent.
  - Provide engineers the meaningful label that matches for each heading.
- Work with engineers to convey the structure of the page.
  - For each heading on the page, provide the engineers with an appropriate heading level to use to match the placement of the heading on the page.
- When implementing section header, do not override default theme colors of section header to ensure the Section Header be easily perceived against its background color. If changing the default colors, the text color must meet a minimum contrast ratio against the background color. See [WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) and [1.4.11 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html) for more information.
- Do not cause any unexpected events to occur on focus or on input of any actionable controls.

### Code Considerations

> - Section Headers must programmatically have a heading level that is set to match the structure of its placement on the page. Work with the Content creators to understand what level to assign each Section Header used.
>   - Developers must apply the appropriate heading levels (1 to 6) prop to the heading. The heading level should match the hierarchical structure of the page.

  <AccordionSectionHeaderAccess />
</div>
> ```jsx
> const AccordionSectionHeader = () => {
>   const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
> 
>   const handleClick = () => {
>     setIsOpen(!isOpen);
>   };
> 
>   const sectionHeaderProps = {
>     isOpen,
>     level: 3,
>     onClick: handleClick,
>   };
> 
>   return (
>     <div>
>       <Card>
>        <Card.Body>
>           <AccoordianExampleTemplate title="Patient is Allergic to:" heading="Documented Allergies" sectionHeaderAttrs={sectionHeaderProps}>
>             <p>Cats</p>
>             <p>Dogs</p>
>             <p>Dust</p>
>             <p>Mold</p>
>             <p>Latex</p>
>           </AccoordianExampleTemplate>
>        </Card.Body>
>       </Card>
>     </div>
>   );
> };
> ```
>   - Terra Section Headers must always follow the correct heading level order and arrangement for where it is placed within other content on the page.
>   - **IMPORTANT**: If a value to the `level` prop is not provided, the heading `text` will not be rendered.
> - For accessibility best practices, it is recommended that consumers should always use `only one` `<h1>` per page or view. The one `<h1>` should be the page title.
>   - A section header should never be a heading level 1.
> - Do not implement any action to activate on the down event. All actions must be initiated on the up event.

## Usability Expectations:

- User expects headings to describe the content they represent.
- User does not expect to navigate to or interact with a Section Header unless it is expandable or collapsible.

## Interaction Details

- Terra Section Header, when expandable or collapsible, must be able to be accessed, interacted with, and acted upon using only the keyboard. Engineers must also ensure actional elements inside a Section Header can:
- Receive focus in the logical reading order of the user.
- Display a visible keyboard focus when the control is in focus.
- Setting a Tabindex should not be required. However, if any elements are assigned a Tabindex, it is critical that a Tabindex higher than 0 is never used.

### Keyboard Navigation

The basic keyboard navigation expectations: 

| Key/Sequence | Description |
|---|---|
|*Tab*| Moves focus on to and off an expandable/collapsible Section Header. User expects to navigate from element to interactable element User expects elements to receive focus in the logical reading order of the page. |
|*Space & Enter*| When focus is on the Section Header of a collapsed section, expands the section and vice-versa.    |
