# Accessibility Guide for Terra Hyperlink

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="2">

1. For each use of Terra Hyperlink, **special care needs to be taken to ensure** the link text alone should convey the function and purpose of the link.
2. Hyperlink **must have a non-empty href** in order to be considered true links and to be accessible to keyboard users. 

</Notice>

### Why is this important?

Hyperlinks are one of the most basic elements of HTML so making links accessible is essential. Hyperlinks are a vital tool for creating an intuitive user experience. However, because links are so fundamental to the functionality of web content, inaccessible or improperly implemented links can be a severe barrier to overall accessibility. 

Accessible hyperlinks are beneficial in many situations, such as:

- **People using screen readers:** Screen reader users may prefer to listen to a list of links. In that case, a screen reader may only read the link text and not the surrounding text.
- **People using speech input software:** Users can speak the text of the link they would like to follow.
- **Keyboard only users** For users navigating by Tab key, it is crucial to see which item has focus at all times.
- **People unable to perceive colors** Pages present links as a different color than their surrounding text. Adding underlines or other non-color indicators helps users who may not see color.

## Accessibility Considerations:

### Code Considerations

Terra Hyperlink has two variants: _Hyperlink_ and _Hyperlink Button_. The table below explains the difference between the two and how to import them into your code.

| Variant | Purpose | Example import |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hyperlink | It represents a hyperlink (a hypertext anchor) labeled by its contents, must add a `href` prop. | `import Hyperlink from terra-hyperlink';` |
| Hyperlink Button | When applications may need to use a button element, must add a `onClick` function to navigate the user | `import HyperlinkButton from 'terra-hyperlink/lib/HyperlinkButton';` |

Developers must ensure the following code considerations:

- Do not override `role=link`. 
  - Use the component that best matches the intended usage &mdash; for example, a link for a link or a button for a button. 
- If non-unique link text must be used, for example, `Learn more`, ensure the link's text is programmatically associated with other content that describes its purpose. 
- Ensure that action is not taken on a hyperlink when it receives focus or when the focus leaves a hyperlink. 
- Ensure that action on a hyperlink occurs on the up event. 
- Links must have a non-empty `href` to be considered proper links and accessible to keyboard users. 
- Ensure that links with icons follow meaningful or decorative use guidelines. 
  - Meaningful icons must have applied the appropriate `alt` attribute. 
  - Decorative icons must be marked as decorative.

### Content Considerations:

> It is most important for link text to make sense without the surrounding sentences or content. The link text alone should convey the function and purpose of the link. Link text should also be unique and easy to speak out loud.
>
> Consider these guidelines when writing link text:
>
> - Avoid link text like “Click Here,” “More,” and “Read More.” These kinds of links can be confusing when a screen reader reads them out of context.
> - Use unique link text where possible. Speech recognition software users may have a bad experience with duplicated link text.
> - It is OK to link a full sentence, but avoid longer.
> - Use judgment when linking full URLs. When linking a URL, consider users who must speak it out loud and who must listen to a screen reader announce it.

## Usability Expectations:

### Interaction Details

None

### Keyboard Navigation

Hyperlinks have the following keyboard navigation expectations:

| Key/Sequence | Description |
|---|---|
|**Tab**| Puts Focus on the hyperlink |
|**Enter**| Executes the link and moves focus to the link target. |

## Support Compliance

Terra is committed to ensuring its components provide maximum possible accessibility. However, using Terra components will not automatically make a product accessible.

Final responsibility lies with the consumers of Terra components &mdash; ensuring proper usage, engineers following correct implementation patterns, and authors crafting content that follows best practice guidance &mdash; to make a product fully accessible.

### WCAG Resources

#### Success Criteria

_Terra Hyperlink **must** meet the following success criteria:_

- [**1.1.1 Non-text Content**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content) - All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed\[...\]. (Level A)
- [**1.3.1 Info and Relationships**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html) - The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that information and relationships that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation format changes. For example, the presentation format changes when the content is read by a screen reader.
- [**2.4.4 Link Purpose**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html) - The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.
- [**2.5.3 Label in Name**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/label-in-name.html) — For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the name contains the text that is presented visually.
- [**3.2.4 Consistent Identification**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/consistent-identification.html) — Content creators must ensure icons used within hyperlinks are used consistently for the same function.
