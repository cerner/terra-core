# Accessibility Guide for Terra Button group

## Why the accessibility of Terra Button group?

The button group component is a group of buttons that allow users to manage content within the page view. If button group is not accessible, it can cause confusion for the user, or worse, prevent the users from interacting with the product. Therefore, it is critical that a button group is implemented correctly to ensure all users can use the button group regardless of how they may interact with it.

## Accessibility Considerations

### Code Considerations

- Ensure all buttons within the button group receive keyboard focus and can be interacted with only the keyboard.   
  - Do NOT override keyboard focus state or use a TABINDEX greater than zero.  
  -	Button group should be coded in the users logical reading order of the page to ensure a meaningful experience.
- Ensure the user can intuitively understand and perceive the selected state from the unselected state.

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="4">

##### Accessibility Guidance: Users must be able to differentitate selected and unselected buttons

###### Single Select variant

<div aria-label="Example demo">
    <SingleSelect />
</div>

```jsx
      <ButtonGroup
        id="controlled-button-group"
        onChange={this.handleSelection}
        selectedKeys={this.state.selectedKey}
      >
        <ButtonGroup.Button text="Dust Allergy" key="single-select1" />
        <ButtonGroup.Button text="Food Allergy" key="single-select2" />
        <ButtonGroup.Button text="Pet Allergy" key="single-select3" />
      </ButtonGroup>
```
###### Multi Select variant

<div aria-label="Example demo">
    <MultiSelect />
</div>

```jsx
      <ButtonGroup
        id="button-group-multi-select"
        onChange={this.handleSelection}
        selectedKeys={this.state.selectedKeys}
        isMultiSelect
      >
        <ButtonGroup.Button text="Dust Allergy" key="multi-select1" />
        <ButtonGroup.Button text="Food Allergy" key="multi-select2" />
        <ButtonGroup.Button text="Pet Allergy" key="multi-select3" />
      </ButtonGroup>
```

##### Accessibility Guidance: Ensure any button with a meaningful icon has an accessible name assigned to the icon

<div aria-label="Example demo">
    <IconGroup />
</div>

```jsx
const iconPrint = <IconPrinter a11yLabel="Print" />;
const iconSave = <IconSave a11yLabel="Save" />;

const ButtonGroupA11yIcon = () => (
  <ButtonGroup>
    <ButtonGroup.Button text="All Documents" icon={iconPrint} key="print" />
    <ButtonGroup.Button text="All Documents" icon={iconSave} key="save" />
  </ButtonGroup>
```
</Notice>

- Ensure all meaningful information that is presented visually is programmatically available to the assistive technology.
  - All buttons within the button group must have an accessible name (button label) which is descriptive of the purpose.
  - The visual label of the button must match the programmatic accessible name.
- Because Button groups are used to control content on the page, they must either have a programmatic association to a visible label on the page or assigned an accessible name for the button group.
  - Button groups within a Toolbar will automatically provide the proper context.

### Content Considerations

- Provide instructions when it is not clear to the user what a button control is for or what they should expect to do with it.
- Must provide engineers with a meaningful and descriptive labels that conveys each button’s purpose.
- Must convey to engineers the Button group label: 
  - Is it text on the page or is it a visually hidden text? 
  - Visually hidden text must be intuitive for sighted users to understand, otherwise the text should be on the page and in proximity to the button group.
- When implementing button group do not override default theme colors of button group to ensure the button group be easily perceived against its background color. 
  - If changing the default colors, the text color must meet a minimum contrast ratio against the background color. See WCAG [1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) and [1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html) for more information.  
  - Not everyone perceives color so never use color as the only way to convey meaning within the interface. Always provide both color and text or a shape together to represent the meaning.
- Ensure the engineers understand the logical reading order of the page.
- Ensure button group always meet the user’s expectations.
  - Never add unexpected behaviors to button group that could cause a change of context on focus or on activation of the button group.
  - Ensure all buttons perform the action on the up event
- After coded, ensure all interactable elements receive keyboard focus in the users reading order and display a visible keyboard focus. Ensure the keyboard user does not get “trapped” somewhere on the page preventing them from the entire workflow.


## Usability Expectations

- User expects to understand what the button group will control.
- User expects each button within the group to have a unique and descriptive label that clearly communicates what action will be performed when selected.
- User expects to be able to tab to a button group and one of the buttons receive visible focus.
- User expects to see and understand when a button is selected.
  - If the button group can have multiple selected buttons, the user expects to be see and understand which buttons are selected and unselected.
- If the Button state is changed, the user expects to be informed (audibly or visually) of the new state.
  - User expects the changing of button states to result in instantaneous feedback. They do not expect to take further action to save the setting change. 
- User expects all icons with the same functionality to be consistently identified by the same name.
  - User also expects icons to be intuitive and to be used consistently across a product.

### Interaction Details

- Mouse users expect the cursor to change to a hand with pointing finger when the Button group is hovered. 
- Keyboard only users expect to see a visible keyboard focus indicator when a button within the button group is in focus.

### Keyboard Navigation

When in focus a button group must have a visible keyboard focus. Additionally, sighted, and unsighted users have basic keyboard navigation expectations:

| Key/Sequence | Description |
|---|---|
|**Tab**| Moves to the button group and one of the buttons in that group receive focus. User expects elements to receive focus in the logical reading order of the page. |
|**Left/Right**| Moves to navigate through the button group element. |
|**Enter/Return/Spacebar**| Executes the selected button action. |
