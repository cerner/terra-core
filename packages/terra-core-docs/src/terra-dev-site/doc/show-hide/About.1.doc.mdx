## Usage

```jsx
import ShowHide from 'terra-show-hide';
```

## Accessibility

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

In order for the component to be accessible, the `focusRef` to the first hidden child node have to be provided. That element will get focus once the full content revealed, that allows the assistive technologies to start reading the hidden content from the place where it was cut off.

</Notice>

#### Accessibility Guidance.
- For the hidden content being a single paragraph `<p>`, wrap the portion of the text that is about to be hidden, in `<span>` tag, and pass a `ref` to that element as `focusRef` prop.
- For multiple children, pass a `ref` to the first child that is not included in preview portion as `focusRef` prop.
