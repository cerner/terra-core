## Implementation Notes:

The Show-Hide component must be composed inside the [Base][1] component with a locale in order for it to load the correct translation strings.

## Usage

```jsx
import ShowHide, { Focuser } from 'terra-show-hide';
```

## Accessibility

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

  To make the Show/Hide component accessible, you must use the `focusRef` prop. This prop allows assistive technologies such as screen readers to move user focus backward to hidden text and announce it when it is disclosed. For backward compatibility, the `focusRef` prop is optional, but is required to meet accessibility requirements.

</Notice>

#### Truncate a paragraph of text
  - At the top level of your component declare a `ref`, pass it as `focusRef` props to `ShowHide` component. 
  - Pass a node with the preview portion of the text as a prop to `ShowHide` component.
  - Use the `Focuser` component inside `<p>` tag. A `Focuser` component allows `ShowHide` component to set focus on the beginning of the focusable text upon opening. 
  - The text splitted in the prefix and focusable text portions has to be passed as string props. The prefix prop should contain the portion of the text that was a part of the preview prop, passed to `ShowHide`.
  - Forward `focusRef` to `Focuser` component.

  ```jsx
  import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';
  import ShowHide, { Focuser } from 'terra-show-hide';

  const MyComponent = () => {
    const focusRef = useRef(null);
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
    const toggleShowHide = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);

    const prefix = 'Patients are requesting greater affordability and efficiency in healthcare. With procedures performed in an ambulatory surgery center costing up to 60% less compared to a hospital outpatient department (1), the demand for these facilities is increasing.';
    const focusableText = 'In fact, the U.S. ambulatory surgery center market is expected to see a 6.9 % compound annual growth rate, reaching $33 billion by 2028. (2) Cerner understands the urgency to grow in the ambulatory surgery center market while continuing to deliver excellent care. Healthcare IT products can help improve clinician efficiency and patient outcomes, as well as enhance communication and data exchange between ambulatory surgery center providers and patients. Read';

    return (
      <ShowHide focusRef={focusRef} preview={ <p>{prefix}</p> } isOpen={isOpen} onChange={toggleShowHide} >
        <p>
          <Focuser ref={this.focusRef} prefix={prefix} focusableText={focusableText} />
        </p>
      </ShowHide>
    );
  }
  ```

#### Multiple children
  Even though the main purpose of the `ShowHide` component is to truncate long paragraps of texts, the content of the `ShowHide` does not have to be one paragraph. It can include links, lists, and any kind of HTML tags as long as the first line of the hidden text is passed as a string prop to `Focuser` component rather than an HTML element.
  
Please note:
  - Links can be placed inside the `p` tag that wraps `Focuser` component both preceding and following it. The prop `prefix` can be omitted if content has been passed as an HTML element preceding `Focuser`.
  - Everythin that precedes `Focuser` component must be also included into the `ShowHide` preview prop.
  - Do not break lists placing `Focuser` inside `li`, as it might break the assistive technologies reading order.

  ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
    import ShowHide, { Focuser } from 'terra-show-hide';

    const MyComponent = () => {
      const focusRef = useRef(null);
      const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
      const toggleShowHide = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);

      const header = 'Bringing clarity to life sciences and healthcare decision-making ';
      const prefix = 'When we accelerate the discovery, development and deployment of life-enhancing insights and therapies, clinicians and patients benefit.';
      const preview = [
        <h3>{header}</h3>,
        <p>{prefix}</p>,
      ];

      return (
        <ShowHide focusRef={focusRef} preview={preview} isOpen={isOpen} onChange={toggleShowHide} >
          <h3>{header}</h3>
          <p>
            <Focuser ref={this.focusRef} prefix={prefix} focusableText="Several factors help bring clarity to life sciences, researchers and clinicians and " />
            <a href="#">guide better care</a>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data-driven research solutions for commercial and real-world evidence collaborators and health providers</li>
            <li>Support to move from simply accumulating and analyzing data to linking and generating deeper insights </li>
            <li>Combined life sciences knowledge, healthcare innovation and collaborative research expertise</li>
          </ul>
        </ShowHide>
      );
    }
  ```

#### First hidden child is an interactive element (link, button, etc)
  - At the top level of your component declare a `ref`.
  - In this case there is no need to use `Focuser`. Forward `focusRef` to the interactive element directly.

  ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
    import ShowHide from 'terra-show-hide';

    const MyComponent = () => {
      const focusRef = useRef(null);
      const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
      const toggleShowHide = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);

      const previewText = 'Although the process is complex and will vary greatly based on regional and economic factors, itâ€™s clear that healthcare entities must start planning their transitions now.';
      const text = 'it expects all Medicare Parts A and B beneficiaries and most Medicaid beneficiaries to be in a value-based care relationship with accountability for quality and total cost of care by 2030.';

      return (
        <ShowHide focusRef={focusRef} preview={<p>{previewText}</p>} isOpen={isOpen} onChange={toggleShowHide} >
          <p>
            {previewText}
            <a ref={this.focusRef} href="#">CMS recently announced</a>
            {text}
          </p>
        </ShowHide>
      );
    }
  ```
