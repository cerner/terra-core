# Accessibility Guide for Terra  Divider

## Why is accessibility of Divider important

> The Divider component helps break content into logical sections. Dividers can be visual or have heading text assigned to describe the new content section. This component must be coded correctly and utilize proper content strategy when applicable to ensure understanding of the content section. At best inaccessible Dividers can cause confusion to people with disabilities. At worst, they can prevent users from navigating the page and understanding the proper context headings afford.

## Accessibility Considerations

### Content Considerations: What do content creators need to do?

- Dividers with text must act as a heading to describe the section.
  - Ensure that the divider text accurately describes the content it represents.
- Content creators must provide engineers with the desired heading text.
  - Work with engineers to understand the content structure of the page to ensure heading levels for all Dividers are appropriate for their placement within the page.
      - Dividers with text should never be a heading level 1.
- Best practice dictates that headings should be used to identify sections of content.
  - If a Divider is used with text, the Divider text will act as the appropriate heading.
  - If no heading text is provided within the Divider, best practice would be to include a heading within the content after the divider.
      - Dividers with no text should not have a heading level assigned to the Divider itself.

<div aria-label="Example Demo">
    <DividerWithTextAccess />
</div>

> ```jsx
> const currentDate = 'November 12, 1955';
>
>  const DividerWithTextAccess = () => (
>   <Card>
>     <Card.Body>
>       <DividerExampleTemplate>
>        <Divider text={currentDate} level={3} />
>       </DividerExampleTemplate>
>     </Card.Body>
>   </Card>
>
> );
> ```

- If default theme colors are overridden, custom colors must meet proper contrast ratios.

### Code Considerations: What do engineers need to do?

<div aria-label="Example Demo">
    <DividerWithoutTextAccess />
</div>

> ```jsx
>  const DividerWithoutTextAccess = () => (
>  <Card>
>    <Card.Body>
>    <DividerExampleTemplate>
>        <Divider />
>    </DividerExampleTemplate>
>   </Card.Body>
>
>  </Card>
> );
> ```

-  Engineers must work with content creators to ensure heading levels for all Dividers are appropriate for their placement on the page.
  - Dividers with text cannot be heading level 1. Heading level 1 is reserved for the page’s title.
  - Engineers must assign the proper heading level prop (H2-H6) to a Divider.
  - Dividers with text must follow the correct heading level order based on its relationship to other headings in the flow of the page’s content.

## Usability Expectations

### Interaction Detail
Terra Divider is not interactable.

### Keyboard Interactions
Because Terra Divider is not interactable, it does not get keyboard focus.
