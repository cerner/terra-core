# Terra Toggle Accessibility Guide

## Why is accessibility of Divider important?

Terra Toggle is a component that hides and progressively discloses new content. If it is not implemented in a way that meets the accessibility criteria, it can be rendered useless to some users preventing them from accessing or understanding the content.

## Accessibility Considerations

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

### Code Considerations: What do engineers need to do?

- Ensure all interactive elements within Terra Toggle have a meaningful label
  - The Toggle button provides more information about a “thing”. Ensure the Toggle is programmatically associated with the “thing” it provides more information about.

<div aria-label="Example demo">
  <TogglePatient />
</div>
<div aria-label="Example code">

    const TogglePatient = () => {
      const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
      const [focused, setFocus] = useState(true);
      const handleOnClick = () => {
        setIsOpen(!isOpen);
      };
      const handleOnKeyDown = (event) => {
        if (event.nativeEvent.keyCode === KEY_TAB) {
          setFocus(true);
        }
      };

      return (
        <Card>
          <Card.Body>
            <div>
              <label htmlFor="Icon-label">
                <IconInformation data-show-focus-styles={focused} focusable onKeyDown={handleOnKeyDown} onMouseDown={() => { setFocus(false); }} onClick={handleOnClick} a11yLabel="information Icon" tabIndex="0" role="button" aria-expanded={isOpen} aria-controls="toggle" id="Icon-label" />
                <span id="Icon-label"> Lab Results</span>
              </label>
              <Toggle isOpen={isOpen} isAnimated>
                <p>
                  Cerner Patient
                  <a href="https://www.cerner.com/solutions/patient">Cerner recognizes the digitization of health care requires improved focus around care coordination and communication, as well as support, empowerment and access to promote patient-centered care.</a>

            </div>
          </Card.Body>
        </Card>
      );
    };

</div>

   - For instance, a Toggle next to the words "Lab Results" is used to provide more information about a patient's lab results should be programmatically associated with and close to the patient's name and the words "Lab Results".

<div aria-label="Example Demo">
  <ToggleLabResults />
</div>
<div aria-label="Example code">

    const ToggleLabResults = () => {
      const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
      const [focused, setFocus] = useState(true);
      const handleOnClick = () => {
        setIsOpen(!isOpen);
      };
      const handleOnKeyDown = (event) => {
        if (event.nativeEvent.keyCode === KEY_TAB) {
          setFocus(true);
        }
      };

      return (

                <span id="Icon-label"> Lab Results</span>

      );
    };

</div>

  - Ensure all icons have alternate content added. [“Alternate Content” SHOULD BE CHANGED TO REFLECT THE PROP NAME USED WITHIN ICONS.]
- Work with the content creators to understand details before writing code.
  - Understand how the Toggle and its content will resize and reflow based on user settings, resizing the viewport, or user zooming into the content.
  - Understand the user's logical reading order and ensure code order follows it.
- Ensure the toggle and any other interactive elements within the Toggle content can be accessed, interacted with, and activated using only the keyboard.
  - Ensure each interactive element has a visible keyboard focus.
  - Ensure Toggle does not cause a keyboard trap.
- Do not override the implicit or explicit role of the Toggle.

</Notice>

### Content Considerations: What do content creators need to do?

- Ensure all interactive elements have descriptive labels that describe their purpose.
  - The Toggle button provides more information about a “thing”. Convey to the engineer the text on the page that further describes the purpose of the Toggle so the Toggle may be programmatically associated with the text on the page.
    - Ensure the Toggle is placed near the text to help users understand the visual relationship.
    - For instance, a Toggle next to the words "Lab Results" is used to provide more information about a patient's lab results should be programmatically associated with and close to the patient's name and the words "Lab Results".
  - For each interactive element within Terra Toggle, provide the engineers with a meaningful label.
  - Ensure each interactive element label is unique to the page.
    - If multiple elements with the same name are used, they must perform the same exact function (e.g., download the same file).
    - Or it must be programmatically associated with other visible and related content on the page that can help users understand the purpose of elements.
 - If the label is text, the visible text must match the programmatic label.
 - All icons used within interactive elements that convey meaning must have an accessible name (alternate content).
   - The icon must be intuitive for the functionality it represents.
   - The icon must be named consistently across the product.
   - Icons must be used to represent the same function consistently (don’t use multiple icons for the same functionality)
 - Any purely decorative icon (does NOT convey any meaning) within a button must be marked as decorative.
- Consider how content will adjust to resizing text or reflowing content at different viewpoints. Users may have settings that change the font size, style, or other text attributes. They may also resize a window or zoom into the content. All these things can cause content to resize or reflow, and when it does, content must not overlap, be cut off, or become unusable.
- Ensure all content is perceivable by meeting all the color requirements.
  - Ensure color is not used as the only way to convey information.
  - Ensure all text and non-text graphics meet the appropriate color contrast requirements. See [1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum) and [1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast) for more information.
- After development, ensure the Toggle and its content is keyboard accessible and works as expected.
  - Ensure the Toggle button has a visible keyboard focus when accessed using the keyboard.
  - Ensure the Toggle does not cause a keyboard trap.

## Usability Expectations

### Interaction Detail

- Users expect to activate the Toggle control do show or hide content on activation.

### Keyboard Expectations

| Key/Sequence | Expectation  |
|---|---|
|*Tab*| Moves forward or backward to any interactive element including form Select Field   |
|*Enter/Return/Spacebar*| With Toggle button in focus, shows or hides the extra content |

## Concerns and Hazards 

- As needed (if any…)

## Support Compliance

### How does Toggle support compliance?

[Insert General blurb used on other accessibility guides]
Terra is committed to ensuring its components provide the maximum possible accessibility. Terra provides the ability to make accessibility products. However, using Terra components will not automatically make a product accessible.

The final responsibility lies with the consumers of Terra components — ensuring proper usage, the programmatic context where needed, the words used to label elements, engineers following correct implementation patterns, and authors crafting content that follows best practice guidance — to make a product fully accessible.

### Primary accessibility criteria for Toggle
