# Terra Alert (Notification Banner)

The Terra Alert component is a notification banner that can be rendered in your application when there is information that you want to bring to the user's attention.

The Alert component supports a number of built-in notification types that render with pre-defined colors and icons that help the user understand the severity and meaning of the notification. The supported notification types and recommended uses are:

- `alert` - displays a critical notification for current emergencies or situations of high severity that need to be addressed promptly
- `error` - recommended to provide feedback of a negative system status such as failures, inabilities, or limitations
- `warning` - recommended to show moderately urgent notifications that are cautionary in nature and forecast potential risk
- `unsatisfied` - recommended to show the user that an unsatisfied or incomplete action needs to be addressed
- `unverified` - recommended to provide feedback that information from outside systems has been included but has yet to be verified by the user
- `advisory` - recommended to provide the user with guidance and/or advice for completing an action
- `information` - recommended to provide general awareness and information that can possibly lead to an action for something that has no associated severity.
- `success` - recommended to provide feedback of a successful system status

A custom notification type is also supported that allows your application to customize a notification that may not fit into the pre-defined types.

## Getting Started

- Install with [npmjs][3]:
  - `npm install terra-alert`

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START Peer Dependencies -->
## Peer Dependencies

This component requires the following peer dependencies be installed in your app for the component to properly function.

| Peer Dependency | Version |
|-|-|
| react | ^16.8.5 |
| react-dom | ^16.8.5 |
| react-intl | ^2.8.0 |

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

## Implementation Notes
The Alert component must be composed inside the [Base][1] component with a locale in order for it to load the correct translation strings.

## Usage

```jsx
import Alert from 'terra-alert';
```

## Accessibility

For further guidance, please view the full [Accessibility Guide](./accessibility-guide).

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

- The `alert` notification type will seize keyboard focus by default when an action element is present. This behavior should only be used when absolutely necessary to interrupt the user's workflow.
- Custom notification banners should always have a title provided to the `title` prop.

</Notice>

#### Accessibility Guidance: Live regions
- For less critical notifications (non-alerts), the notification banner should be in an `aria-live="polite"` region. See example code below.
- Avoid mixing critical alert notifications and less critical notifications in the same region.

<div aria-label="Example code">

    import Alert from 'terra-alert';

    <>
        // This less critical notification should be in polite aria-live region so screen reader users are notified.
        <div aria-live="polite">
            {isOpen && (
                <Alert type="success">
                    This notification is a less critical and should be polite.
                </Alert>
            )}
        </div>

        // Alert notifications are implicitly assertive, no aria-live needed
        // It is recommended to keep these separate from polite aria-live regions.
        <div>
            {isOpen && (
                <Alert type="alert">
                    This notification is a critical alert that is interruptive.
                </Alert>
            )}
        </div>
    </>

</div>

## Testing

Terra Alert uses `uuid` which changes the component's description id dynamically. To mock it with the Jest testing library, `jest.mock` can be used.

If Enzyme `shallow` is being used for the tests then the mock may not be required depending on the depth of the returned wrapper. However, if `mount` is used then `uuid` should be mocked as shown below:

```js
// using a variable may result in failures. For best results, hardcode the mock return value.
jest.mock('uuid', () => ({ v4: () => '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' }));

```
