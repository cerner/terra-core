# Accessibility Guide for Terra Alert

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="2">

Using alerts improperly may prevent some of your users from understanding your UI.

</Notice>

<Whitespace />

## Why is this important?

Alert is a form of notifications with varying criticalities that should inform and assist the user with their task.

> "An alert is an element that displays a brief, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task."
> _&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; excerpt from <Hyperlink href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/" variant="external">ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG): Alert Pattern</Hyperlink>_[<sup>[1]</sup>](/components/cerner-terra-core-docs/alert/accessibility-guide#linked-references)

## Accessibility Considerations

### Code Considerations

#### Consistency

The use of an alert notification should be consistent in order to provide the user the best experience.

#### Alert Criticality

The user only expects to be interrupted for notifications (alerts) that are of high criticality.
Less critical notifications should wait until the current task is complete before presenting to the user.

By default, Terra Alert will set the role to `"alert"` for the `alert` type and `"status"` for all other types.
Terra Alert has an optional role prop but should be used carefully when the default does not meet accessibility or usability expectations.

| Role | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Alert | See <Hyperlink href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/#alert" variant="external">Alert</Hyperlink>[<sup>[2]</sup>](/components/cerner-terra-core-docs/alert/accessibility-guide#linked-references) - "A type of live region with important, and usually time-sensitive, information." |
| Status | See <Hyperlink href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/#status" variant="external">Status</Hyperlink>[<sup>[2]</sup>](/components/cerner-terra-core-docs/alert/accessibility-guide#linked-references) - "A type of live region whose content is advisory information for the user but is not important enough to justify an alert, often but not necessarily presented as a status bar." |

#### Assistive technologies

In combination with the Alert Criticality, screen reader users should understand the importance of the alert when presented.

The `"alert"` role will interrupt the user and announce the high critical notification immediately.
The `"status"` role will not interrupt the user and present politely.

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="5">

###### Accessibility Guidance: Live regions

For screen readers to pick up and announce a newly rendered alert, the alert must be within an live region.
To enable assistive technologies the ability to inform the user of a less critical alert in a polite (non-interruptive) way, ensure the Alert is
within an element where `aria-live="polite"`.

Please note: the `"alert"` role implicitly has aria-live value of `assertive` and will interrupt without being in a region where aria-live is previously present.

<div aria-label="Example code">

    import Alert from 'terra-alert';

    <div aria-live="polite">
        {isOpen && (
            <Alert>
                Meaningful alert content.
            </Alert>
        )}
    </div>
