# Accessibility Guide for Terra Fieldset

## Why the accessibility of Fieldset is important 

> Fieldset are some of the most used controls across products. Because they are so ubiquitous, users need to understand their purpose and be able to interact with them. However, if Fieldset are not implemented following best practices, users may fail to understand what the field is for, or worse, may not be able to interact with the input. It is critical to users that all Fieldset must be accessible to effectively understand and interact with a field.

## Accessibility Considerations

### Content Considerations: What do content creators need to do?

- Consider adding instructions at the beginning of the form or when content may be complex or out of the ordinary.
  - Use clear and concise wording that helps the user understand what is expected of them.
- Ensure all Fieldset have a descriptive label that accurately describes its purpose.
  - Work with the engineer to ensure programmatic field names created using ARIA match the visible label of the field.
    - For example, if the visible input label says, “Where do you live” and the programmatic name is “Address”, some users will not be able to activate the control to edit the field.
  - Ensure each field label is unique to the page.
    - The best practice is to never use the same label for multiple fields that are asking for different data on the same page. For example, two fields named “Address” would be an accessibility barrier for several users. Instead, provide more specific labels like, “Home Address” and “Business Address”.
    - Or groups of related fields can be placed inside of a fieldset which will create the necessary programmatic context. For example, the same page can have two fields named “Address” if each are in their own respective fieldset labeled “Home” and “Work”.
  - If there is any specific requirement for the user to make a field valid, that requirement must be presented visibly either in the field label or within helper text.
    - If a Fieldset is required, it must be set as required, have the required red asterisk, and the form itself should have instructions that any item marked with the asterisk is required.
    - If there is a specific format to the field, it must be indicated. For example, MM/DD/YYYY for a date, or XXX-XXX-XXXX for a phone number.
    - If a field only accepts numbers, letters, or a certain number of characters, those requirements must also be available to all users in text associated to the field (in helper text or within the Fieldset label). 
  - When creating error messaging, ensure the message provides enough context the user can understand what the problem is and how to fix it. Use clear and concise messaging.
  - If any icons are used to convey meaning in conjunction with a Fieldset, the icon must have an accessible name (alternate content). For example, a help icon next to a field.
    - The icon must be intuitive for the functionality it represents.
    - The icon must be named consistently across the product and accurately reflect the purpose of the icon.
    - The icons must be used to consistently represent the same function (don’t use multiple icons for the same functionality).
    - The icon must have alternate content that reflects the Fieldset it is related to, or it must be programmatically associated to the field. Work with engineers when needed to add programmatic association of icons to the fields.
  - Any purely decorative icon (does not convey ANY meaning) must be marked as decorative.
  - Consider how forms resize and reflow at different breakpoints and form factors.
    - Convey to engineers how content should resize and reflow.
  - Do not override default Fieldset colors.
   - If colors are changed, all Fieldset content (visible label, required asterisk, helper text, instructions, helper text, and the field itself) must meet color contrast requirements against their respective backgrounds.
  - Ensure the engineer understands the logical reading order of the form.
  - After coded:
    - Ensure nothing unexpected happens on focus or on input of the Fieldset.
    - Ensure all Fieldset can receive keyboard focus, have a visible keyboard focus indication when in focus, and can be interacted with and acted upon using only the keyboard.
    - Ensure all Fieldset receive focus in the users logical reading order and the focus order does not affect the meaning of content.

### Code Considerations: What do engineers need to do?

- Ensure the code order of Fieldset match the users logical reading order.
  - Ensure all Fieldset can receive keyboard focus.
  - Do not override the default keyboard focus indicator unless to reverse out of a dark background for perceivability. Do not override the visible focus indicator.
  - Never implement a TABINDEX value of anything greater than zero.
  - Ensure nothing unexpected happens on focus or on input of a Fieldset.
- Work with Content Creators to understand how content should resize and reflow at different breakpoints and form factors to ensure content is not artificially constrained or cut off at smaller view ports.
- Ensure all Fieldset are implemented correctly to programmatically associate all related content (visible label, helper text, error messaging) to the field
  - Ensure the visible Input Label matches any artificially applied programmatic label.
    - For example, the visible Input label is “Where do you live” and an ARIA-LABEL is “Address” would be a failure. Both should match.
  - Any requirement of the field must be visible with the field. Work with the content creator to understand any requirements (e.g., “required” field, specific format of the field, number of characters of the field, etc.).
    - Required fields must have the red asterisk as a required indicator for the user see next to the Fieldset label.
  - Do not change the placement of any of the related content to other areas around the field. For example, do not move the input label creating large gaps between the field and the label.
- Ensure validation can provide the users necessary details to help them resolve any errors.
  - Ensure error messaging should provide error suggestions when possible.

<div>
  <Fieldset
    type="checkbox"
    legend="Please Enter Patient full name here"
    name="children_present"
    value="children_present"
    error="All fields must be filled out"

## Usability Expectations

### Usability Expectations
- The user expects to understand the purpose of the field and enter details.
- The user expects to understand any requirements of the field. For example, is it required, does it have a special format, does it only accept certain number of characters, etc.

### Keyboard Expectations
In general, all Fieldset should receive initial keyboard focus by tabbing on to the field. Each Fieldset will its own set of keyboard behaviors. See the individual form elements for specific keyboard expectations of each.

## Support Compliance

### How does Terra Fieldset support compliance?

Terra is committed to ensuring its components provide maximum possible accessibility. Terra provides the ability to make accessibility products. However, using Terra components will not automatically make a product accessible.

Final responsibility lies with the consumers of Terra components — ensuring proper usage, programmatic context where needed, the words used to label elements, engineers following correct implementation patterns, and authors crafting content that follows best practice guidance — to make a product fully accessible.
