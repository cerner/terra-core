# Terra Icon

The terra-icon component is used to visually represent a literal or symbolic object intended to initiate an action, communicate a status, or navigate the workflow.
Icons can be `meaningful` where they used to convey a semantic meaning or `decorative` where they are are simply used for aesthetic purposes.

See [Usage](#usage) for more information.

## Getting Started

- Install with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
  - `npm install terra-icon`

## Peer Dependencies

This component requires the following peer dependencies be installed in your app for the component to properly function.

| Peer Dependency | Version |
|-----------------|---------|

{/* AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END */}

## Usage
The value for `a11yLabel` prop is required for the icons that are `meaningful` which means that they are intended to convey meaning. 
```jsx
import IconAdd from 'terra-icon/lib/icon/IconAdd';
import IconEdit from 'terra-icon/lib/icon/IconEdit';

<div>
  <IconAdd a11yLabel="add item"/>
  <IconEdit a11yLabel="edit item"/>
</div>
```

If icons are intended for aesthetic purposes (`decorative` icons) then `a11yLabel` can be ignored.
```jsx
import IconAllergy from 'terra-icon/lib/icon/IconAllergy';
import IconScratchPad from 'terra-icon/lib/icon/IconScratchPad';

<div>
  <IconAllergy />
  <IconScratchPad />
</div>
```
