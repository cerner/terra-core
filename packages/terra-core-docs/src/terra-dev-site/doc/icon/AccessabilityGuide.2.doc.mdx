## Accessibility Considerations:

### Code Considerations

Intro paragraph for Code Considerations.

Include as many level 4 section headers as needed.

- If the sections are prioritized, than use numbering: e.g. `#### 1. Most Important` `#### 2. Second Most Important`
- If the sections are A or B options, append "recommended" to the title: e.g. `#### 1. Concept Title _(recommended)_` `#### 2. Concept Title`
- Appending "always" and "as needed" to the title if something is critical to note: e.g. `#### Concept Title _(always)_` `#### 2. Concept Title _(as needed)_`

#### {title of important concept}

Add text or list of details, perhaps include a notices component with code example.

> | _Bad_              | _Good_              |
> | ------------------ | ------------------- |
> | Show something bad | Show something good |

#### {title of important concept} _(recommended)_

Add text or list of details, perhaps include a notices component with code example.

### Content Considerations

Sample intro paragraph: As authors create text, choosing words and phrases for {component name} — the content itself is also a very important factor in ensuring proper accessibility in addition to the coding techniques listed above.

## Usability Expectations:

### Interaction Details

- link, list item 1
- link, list item 2
- link, list item 3

### Keyboard Navigation

| Key/Sequence | Description             |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Key**      | description of behavior |
| **Key**      | description of behavior |
| **Key**      | description of behavior |
| **Key**      | description of behavior |

## Concerns & Hazards:

### Incorrect Use

Use this section only as needed to indicate critical problems if something is done incorrectly, or to warn authors against unsupported scenarios
If will have critical affects: consider including a bad example with the "not-supported" notices component.

## Support Compliance:

### WCAG Resources

#### Success Criteria

_{Component name} **must** meet the following success criteria:_

- [**1.3.1 Info and Relationships**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html). - The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that information and relationships that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation format changes. For example, the presentation format changes when the content is read by a screen reader.
- [**0.0.0. Criteria Name**](https://www.link-to-criteria.html) - copy main paragraph text for the criteria.

#### Related or Additional Supporting Criteria

_Apart from the above criteria, the following criteria are related or support the primary success criteria:_

- [**0.0.0. Criteria Name**](https://www.link-to-criteria.html) - copy main paragraph text for the criteria.
- [**0.0.0. Criteria Name**](https://www.link-to-criteria.html) - copy main paragraph text for the criteria.
