# Terra Icon Upgrade Guide

- [Upgrading from 3.0 to 4.0](#upgrading-from-3.0-to-4.0)
- [Upgrading from 2.0 to 3.0](#upgrading-from-2.0-to-3.0)

## Upgrading from 3.0 to 4.0

- Icons are now split into `meaningful icons` and `decorative icons`. By default, icons are imported as `meaningful`. To import `decorative` icons, the import statement must be updated:

```js
// importing a meaninful icon
import Star           from "terra-icon/lib/icon/IconFeaturedOutlineYellow";

// importing a decorative icon
import DecorativeStar from "terra-icon/lib/icon/decorative/IconFeaturedOutlineYellow";
```

For more information on the difference between `meaningful` and `decorative` icons, see [Acessibility Guide](/components/cerner-terra-core-docs/icon/accessibility-guide).

### Prop changes

- `ariaLabel` has been deprecated and is replaced by the `a11yLabel` prop.
- `a11yLabel` is now _required_ if importing a meaningful icon.
