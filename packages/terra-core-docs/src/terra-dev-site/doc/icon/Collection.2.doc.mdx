# Terra Icon Collection

## Using This Tool

This tool aims to ease adherence to Cerner's design standards by presenting usage and Human Factors guidance for each of Cerner's icons and by allowing you to search for icons based on usage criteria. Note: Just because a search term shows an icon as a result, does not mean that icon's meaning reflects that. Please refer to each icon's "Meaning", "Functions", and 
"HF Guidance" sections.

### Searching

In the search bar below, you can enter keywords to filter the displayed icons by attributes like meaning and visual appearance. For example, searching for "scheduling" would show all icons related to scheduling. Searching for "green" would show all icons containing the color green.

You can also filter by the function the icons can serve in a UI.
