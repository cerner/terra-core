# Terra Badge

Badges are used to represent items like number of filtered items, number of unread items, or to represent state. If you need a selectable annotation consider using a label instead.

## Usage

```jsx
import Badge from 'terra-badge';
```

To implement an accessible terra badge:

- Ensure a meaningful text is provided as `text` prop for terra-badge and choose appropriate intent that matches the defination of Badge text. 

- Ensure Information is not conveyed by only color added by different intent of terra-badge.

- Ensure that the terra-badge is provided with visually hidden text to convey the purpose of the badge to users via screen reader or similar assistive technologies when required.

- When multiple badges are used together, Consider following steps which will help users to perceive or understand the difference between the two badges.

  - Add an icon to visually convey information.
  - Add a visually-hidden-text to convey information for screen reader users.
  - Avoid having badges with similar intent on group.

- visually-hidden-text should be ignored when the badge color and text is sufficient to convey information of badge.
