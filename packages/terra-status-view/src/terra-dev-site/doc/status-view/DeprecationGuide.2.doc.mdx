## Deprecation Notice
The terra-status-view npm package is deprecated as of `4.45.0`. terra-status-view will be removed from the repo in a future version, but the package will remain on npm.

### What deprecation means
Any apps that currently use terra-status-view will continue to work as-is.
However, the terra-status-view package will no longer continue to be supported / developed.

## Why?
The reason behind terra-status-view deprecation is to integrate the presentation of overlays with the overall application framework to ensure better accessibility.

## How to replace this package?
This package can be replaced with [terra-application-status-overlay](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/application/terra-application/components/application-status-overlay).
The `terra-application-status-overlay` is constrained to predefined variants to promote unified framework pattern. Hence, it will not support custom variants.
