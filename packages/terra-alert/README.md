[![Build Status](https://badgen.net/travis/cerner/terra-core)](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core)

The Terra Alert component is a notification banner that can be rendered in your application when there is information that you want to bring to the user's attention. The Alert component supports a number of built-in notification types that render with pre-defined colors and icons that help the user understand the severity and meaning of the notification. A custom notification type is also supported that allows your application to customize an alert that may not fit into the pre-defined types.
