# Terra Alert

The Terra Alert component is a notification banner that can be rendered in your application when there is information that you want to bring to the user's attention.

The Alert component supports a number of built-in notification types that render with pre-defined colors and icons that help the user understand the severity and meaning of the notification. The supported alert types and recommended uses are:

- `alert` - displays a critical notification for current emergencies or situations of high severity that need to be addressed promptly
- `error` - recommended to provide feedback of a negative system status such as failures, inabilities, or limitations
- `warning` - recommended to show moderately urgent notifications that are cautionary in nature and forecast potential risk
- `unsatisfied` - recommended to show the user that an unsatisfied or incomplete action needs to be addressed
- `unverified` - recommended to provide feedback that information from outside systems has been included but has yet to be verified by the user
- `advisory` - recommended to provide the user with guidance and/or advice for completing an action
- `information` - recommended to provide general awareness and information that can possibly lead to an action for something that has no associated severity.
- `success` - recommended to provide feedback of a successful system status

A custom notification type is also supported that allows your application to customize an alert that may not fit into the pre-defined types.
