# Terra Signature


[![NPM version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/terra-signature)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/terra-signature)
[![Build Status](https://badgen.net/travis/cerner/terra-core)](https://travis-ci.com/cerner/terra-core)

The terra-signature component provides users a way to define a signature with a series of line segments.
The component can define line width, line color, and optionally display a signature if the line segments have
already been recorded. Exiting the canvas then re-entering continues the drawing, as long as the pointer does not exit the confines of the browser. For mouse usage, only left click drawing is enabled.
