### Responsive Grid Columns

It is possible to specify how many columns a section should consume at each breakpoint. The breakpoints are min-width, so the largest set breakpoint will carry over into larger sizes. Additionally, responsive columns will stack below the smallest defined breakpoint. To make the columns responsive, add the class(s) which apply to the breakpoint(s) and the column count desired.

The available sizes (unless altered via theming) are:

- tiny
- small
- medium
- large
- huge

So an example set of classes that might be applied to a given section is:

- `terra-Grid-col--tiny-12`
- `terra-Grid-col--small-3`
- `terra-Grid-col--medium-2`
- `terra-Grid-col--large-1"`
