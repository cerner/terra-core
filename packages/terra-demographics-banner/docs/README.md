# Terra Demographics Banner

The demographics component is used to display demographic information about a person in a condensed, easy to read format. Demographics Banner must be inside the Base component with locale. All related translations are required to be loaded before Demographics Banner renders.

## Getting Started

- Install with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
```
npm install terra-demographics-banner
```

The demographics banner will display differently depending on the resolution of the browser. If the resolution is less than that of the standard tablet width (767px), then the demographics banner will be stacked, and the profile image will not be displayed. If the resolution is greater than or equal to the tablet width, the banner will display horizontally, and the profile image will be displayed to the user.
