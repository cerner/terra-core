Terra-date-picker is a controlled input component that provides users a way to enter or select a date from the date picker. terra-date-picker is essentially a wrapper for [react-datepicker][1] and leverages many of its props. One important difference between terra-date-picker and [react-datepicker][1] is that all of the date props in [react-datepicker][1] must be a [moment][2] object whereas the date props in terra-date-picker are ISO 8601 representation of the date.

This is a controlled component because it manages the state of the value in the input. Because this is a controlled input component, it cannot accept the defaultValue prop as it always uses the value prop. React does not allow having both the defaultValue and value props.
