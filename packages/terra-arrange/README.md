# Terra Arrange


[![NPM version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/terra-arrange)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/terra-arrange)
[![Build Status](https://badgen.net/travis/cerner/terra-core)](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core)

The arrange component allows an item that has an intrinsic width, such as an icon or an image, to be offset from a group of associated content. When the group of associated content wraps, it will stay aligned next to the offset content rather than wrap below it.
