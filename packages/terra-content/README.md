[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core)

The content component provides styles for commonly used HTML elements such as headers, paragraphs, lists, images, and more. This component ensures consistent styling between different browsers in a similar fashion to normalize.css. These styles are in a component as opposed to being used globally to ensure that Terra is opt in. As a result, other solutions will not be styled by this component.
