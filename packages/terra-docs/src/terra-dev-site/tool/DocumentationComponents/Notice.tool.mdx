A documentation component intended to provide a "notice" of various types to be used throughout the document.

## Getting Started

- Install with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
  - `npm install @cerner/terra-docs`

## Usage

import { Notice } from '@cerner/terra-docs';
```

## Usage in MDX

MDX, where we generally assume this component is being used, has an interesting concept called interleaving. interleaving is where you can replace child components passed to other react components with an MDX component, see the example below.

```jsx

// This example will render the children as a string.
<Notice>

</Notice>

// This example will render the children an MDX component that will convert the string to markdown, links to be rendered in the notice.
