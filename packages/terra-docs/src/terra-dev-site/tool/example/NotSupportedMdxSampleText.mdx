Consumers should be aware to not create the following situations:  

```diff
    <div id="incorrect-usage-of-a-component">
-     <DontDoThis>
-       Example of Something that is Unsupported if Addded or Used Incorrectly
-     </DontDoThis>
      <TerraComponent
        prop="Example of Component Use"
      />
-       <DontRemoveThis>
-         Example of Something that is Unsupported if Removed or Used Incorrectly
-       </DontRemoveThis>
      </TerraComponent>
    </div>
```

In this example, adding the `DontDoThis` or removing the `DontRemoveThis` component will break accesibility and all interactions. General tips that reiterate what will reusult in incorrect use include:

* Always do this ...
* Never do this ...

Consumers should be aware to not create this situation by remembering {ABC} and {XYZ}, include helpful references like [google](https://www.google.com) for more information.
