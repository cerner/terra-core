The menu is a popup component that displays a list of items, item groups, and dividers. Menu Items can be actionable, have toggle-style selection, or have nested submenu items. Menu Item groups are a single-select grouping of menu items. 
The Menu will determine the height of the popup based on the number of items in the main menu.
