# Terra i18n Upgrade Guide

## Changes from 3.0 to 4.0

The terra-i18n `aggregate-translations` pre-build tool has been removed from this package.

Along with this, the post-install script which wrote default intl and translation loaders has been removed.

To upgrade, use the [`aggregate-translations` pre-build tool](https://github.com/cerner/terra-aggregate-translations#--terra-aggregate-translations) to generate `intlLoaders` and `translationLoaders` files needed for internationalizing terra components instead of relying on the `intlLoaders` and `translationLoaders` files being generated by the terra-i18n postinstall step.

## Changes from 2.0 to 3.0
