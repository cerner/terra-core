## Getting Started

This component is not intended for direct usage by developers. It is recommended to use the `terra-base` component instead which acts as an abstraction around terra-i18n and react-intl's Intl Provider component. See [`terra-base documentation`](https://github.com/cerner/terra-core/tree/master/packages/terra-base) to get started.

However, terra-i18n can be installed with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
  - `npm install terra-i18n`
  - `yarn add terra-i18n`
