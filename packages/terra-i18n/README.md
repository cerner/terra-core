## Getting Started

This component is not intended for direct usage by developers. It is recommended to use the `terra-base` component instead which acts as an abstraction around terra-i18n and react-intl's Intl Provider component. See [`terra-base documentation`](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-core/components/terra-base/base/base) to get started.

However, terra-i18n can be installed with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com):
  - `npm install terra-i18n`
