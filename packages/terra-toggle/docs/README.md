# Terra Toggle

Toggle component that transitions content in and out. Use `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` state on the triggering component. The objective of `aria-expanded` state is to indicate whether regions of the content are collapsible, and to expose whether a region is currently expanded or collapsed.The `aria-controls` state indicates the element (terra-toggle) that is controlled by the triggering element. For toggle button functionality, see [terra-toggle-button](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/#/components/terra-toggle-button/toggle-button/toggle-button).
