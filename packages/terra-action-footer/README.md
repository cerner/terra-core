[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core)

The terra-action-footer component is a footer bar that contains sockets to place items in the form of buttons and hyperlinks used to perform actions. The default variant contains a start and end socket, while the centered variant has only a center socket. If no actions are provided, the footer bar defaults to a 10px equivalent height and maintains the top border.
