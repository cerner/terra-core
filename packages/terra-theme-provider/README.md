# Terra Theme Provider


[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/terra-theme-provider.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/terra-theme-provider)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cerner/terra-core)

The theme provider component provides a theme to Terra UI components rendered within it via CSS custom properties a.k.a CSS variables. This is accomplished by setting a CSS class which contains defined CSS custom properties for the specified theme on the DOM element that wraps the children rendered by the theme provider.

*Note:* The CSS custom properties applied via the theme provider only work in browsers which have native support for CSS custom properties.
