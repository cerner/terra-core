## Examples
Terra includes styling for all standard headings `h1` through `h6`, as well as styles that match the size of their respective heading. Headings should be
marked up according to the document hierarchy, not appearance. To facilitate navigation and understanding of overall document structure, authors should use
headings that are properly nested (e.g., `h1` followed by `h2`, `h2` followed by `h2` or `h3`, `h3` followed by `h3` or `h4`, etc.). The `level` prop accepts
one of the following numbers:

`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`
<HeadingLevels />

The `size` prop can be used to alter the default size of any `Heading` component whenever necessary. The `size` prop accepts one of the following strings:

`huge`, `large`, `medium`, `small`, `tiny`, `mini`
<HeadingSizes />
<HeadingColors description="By passing in a className, authors can manually set the text color of any '<Heading />' component."/>

The `weight` prop can be used to specify the weight or boldness of the `Heading` component. Heading components default to a `font-weight` of `700`. The `weight` prop accepts one of the following numbers:

`200`, `400`, `700`
<HeadingWeights />

The `isVisuallyHidden` prop can be used to hide the content visually, yet provide the content to screen readers.

<HeadingVariations description="You can mix and match props on the '<Heading />' component to create various heading styles."/>
