## Heading Levels

Terra includes styling for all standard headings `h1` through `h6`, as well as styles that match the size of their respective heading. Headings should be marked up according to the document hierarchy, not appearance. To facilitate navigation and understanding of overall document structure, authors should use headings that are properly nested (e.g., `h1` followed by `h2`, `h2` followed by `h2` or `h3`, `h3` followed by `h3` or `h4`, etc.). The `level` prop accepts one of the following numbers:

`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`
