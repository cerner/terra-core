# Split Button

The Split Button provides the user with the ability to choose the primary action or an action from a listing of alternative actions.
An example is email. The primary action is _reply_, but the user can also _forward_, or _reply all_. _Reply_ would be the primary action, while _forward_ and _reply_ would be contained inside the dropdown.

Children must be the `Button` subcomponent for proper functionality and appearance.
