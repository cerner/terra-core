# Terra Visually Hidden Text

Visually Hidden Text is a component designed for screen readers that renders text on the dom, but is not visible to the UI. Some components such as badge will have a visual indication to note their hierarchy on the page, but that indication is lost when a screen reader is used on the web page. Visually Hidden text would allow your application to provide that additional context to a screen reader.

Another reason for this component is when you want to produce more semantic markup for a screen reader only experience. Some various examples include:

- You may want to provide a visually hidden header to allow for better readability.
- You may need to provide different instructions for visual users vs non visual users.
- div nodes have a difficult understanding the aria-label attributes as well.

In these instances, it's recommended to use visually hidden text.
